# EPF-RUDN-Seismic-test

This code allows to analyze the data from volcanoes all around the world. Here are steps needed in order to use properly the data :

STEP 1. Open ArcGIS Pro and create a new project.

STEP 2. Open Jupyter Notebook from the ArcGIS folder, then go where the "ArcPy_Volcano_Risk_Code.ipynb" file is stored and open it.

STEP3. Run the first part of the code and when it is finished, run the second part of the code (corresponding to the main program). Stay until the seoncd part is completly done as you will need to enter a buffer distance. 

STEP 4. Return to ArcGIS Pro and update the "out_gdb.gdb" file. Then select the Raster files you want to see from that same file with a right clic.
